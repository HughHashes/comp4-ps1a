## Description
The project takes a string that represents a binary number of digits.
It then runs it through a LFSR of the Fibonnaci verity.

### Features
Describe the representation you used and why you did things that way.

### Issues
As far as I am aware, after my testing everything performs as intended and there are no mistakes.

### Tests
In my boost unit cases I wanted to check and error cases along with a few more standard tests to ensure everything was working correctly. So if the user doesn't input a valid binary number and if the number isn't 16 characters.

### Extra Credit
I am not sure it counts but I added a function to make sure the input string is valid.
